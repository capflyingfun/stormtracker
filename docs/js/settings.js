  {title:'🏠 Getting Started',text:'StormTracker detects storms around your location using live radar data. On first launch, allow GPS access or search for your location using the 🗺️ button in the header. The app scans for precipitation within an 80-mile radius and shows results across five tabs. All settings — units, gauge style, time format, AI, alerts, and more — are accessible via the ⚙️ gear icon in the header.'},
  {title:'🌤️ Weather Tab',text:'Your main dashboard. Shows current conditions (temperature, wind, humidity, pressure), a <b>wind gauge</b> with real-time animated direction, and a <b>Radar Sonar</b> mini-map.<br><br><b>New in v2.84:</b> The hero section now includes <b>Fog Risk</b> (multi-factor assessment: spread + wind + time of day + cloud cover), <b>Atmospheric Stability</b> (Stable / Cond. Unstable / Unstable based on FAA weather theory), <b>estimated cloud base</b> (spread × 400ft), and <b>temperature inversion detection</b> warnings. All values respect your Imperial/Metric unit settings.<br><br><b>Wind Gauge:</b> Choose from 5 switchable styles in Settings — <b>Neon</b> (default animated ring), <b>Marine</b> (nautical compass with LED digits), <b>Minimal</b> (clean arc with arrow), <b>G1000</b> (Garmin-style 3-panel with compass rose, speed tape, and pressure tape), and <b>Speedometer</b> (classic dial with sweeping needle). The G1000 also supports <b>Gyro Compass</b> mode — point your phone at a storm and the compass rotates with you.<br><br><b>Radar Sonar:</b> A bird\'s-eye view showing storm cells as colored blips and arrows for approaching storms. Use <b>+/−</b> buttons to zoom between 15 and 80 miles. Tap the ⚙️ gear on the sonar to customize sweep speed, fade duration, dot opacity, glow intensity, grid brightness, dBZ floor, and overlay toggles. Tap "Open Radar →" to jump to the full map.'},
  {title:'📡 Radar Tab',text:'The full interactive map. Storm cells appear as colored arrows showing movement direction. A <b>cyan crosshair</b> marks the exact map center for precise targeting.

HD scans sync the sonar zoom to 15mi for maximum detail.'},
  {title:'➤ ILS Approach Cone',text:'The animated cone on the radar shows where storms are heading relative to you. It\'s inspired by an airport ILS (Instrument Landing System) — a cone of dots extends from the storm source through your location. <b>White dots</b> = no storms approaching. <b>Colored dots</b> = intensity-matched to approaching storm dBZ levels. The cone is always on once wind data is received.'},
  {title:'🌩️ Storms Tab',text:'Lists all detected storm cells with details: peak dBZ, rain rate, distance, bearing, movement (direction with degrees), and ETA.

const CHANGELOG=[
  {ver:'v5.26',date:'2026-06-19',items:['🤖 <b>AI-written alerts (optional)</b> — turn this on under <b>Settings → Background alerts</b> and your storm notifications get rephrased into one short, natural sentence (using the app’s built-in AI) instead of the standard wording. The most urgent threat always stays first, and if the AI is ever unavailable you simply get the normal alert. Off by default.','🔔 <b>“Only notify on changes” (optional)</b> — also under <b>Settings → Background alerts</b>. When on, StormTracker stops re-buzzing you about a situation that hasn’t changed — you get a notification when something <b>new</b> develops or a storm shifts, not the same alert over and over. Severe storms, lightning, and official <b>warnings</b> still repeat as usual so you never miss the serious stuff. Off by default.'],},
  {ver:'v5.25',date:'2026-06-19',items:['🌩️ <b>New “Nearby strong storms” heads-up</b> — when strong storms (45+ dBZ) are sitting inside your watch radius but moving <b>parallel or away</b> — not heading at you — you’ll now get a low-key notification like “Strong storms ~22 mi to the north, moving east ~19 mph — not heading your way, but stay aware.” It fills the gap where the <b>Storms</b> tab reads 0 because nothing’s actually inbound (like a line passing to your north all day). It’s low priority and fires at most about once every couple hours per area; official warnings, inbound-storm and lightning alerts still come through first as before. Switch it off anytime under <b>Settings → Background alerts → Nearby strong storms</b>.'],},
  {ver:'v5.24',date:'2026-06-19',items:['🔌 <b>Fixed alerts dropping out</b> — the app was accidentally cutting its own link to Apple’s notification service every single time you opened it, then scrambling to rebuild it. That’s the most likely reason notifications worked for a while and then went quiet. It no longer does this — the connection now stays put.','🔁 <b>Reconnects only when it actually needs to</b> — opening StormTracker now checks the notification link and reconnects only if it really broke, instead of churning it every time (which itself wore down iPhone’s hidden alert “budget”).','⏱️ <b>Instant re-confirm after a reset</b> — tapping “Re-subscribe” now also clears the 45-minute spacing on routine updates, so the very next scan re-confirms an active storm within a few minutes instead of leaving you waiting. Severe storms, lightning, and official warnings still come through right away as before.'],},
  {ver:'v5.23',date:'2026-06-19',items:['🔄 <b>“Re-subscribe” button for notifications</b> — added under Settings → Background alerts. If alerts ever stop showing on your iPhone, tap it to reset the connection with a fresh start — your manage code and all your settings are kept.','🌧️ <b>Cleaner Rain Clock detail</b> — tapping a colored arc no longer shows a confusing “0.0 mi” distance for forecast cells. Real storms still show their distance; pure-forecast cells (which sit right at your location) just show the strength and timing.'],},
  {ver:'v5.22',date:'2026-06-19',items:['🔔 <b>More reliable iPhone alerts</b> — notifications on a Home-Screen iPhone have a small hidden "budget" that Apple quietly uses up; once it\'s gone, it stops showing alerts even though everything reports success. StormTracker now spends that budget carefully: routine rain/storm updates are spaced further apart (about 45 min) so there\'s always headroom for what matters — severe storms, lightning, and official warnings still arrive fast. Lightning now escalates quickly instead of waiting, and the “Send test notification” button no longer silently overwrites itself when tapped several times.','🛟 <b>Self-healing alerts</b> — if iPhone ever quietly drops your alert subscription, StormTracker now notices when you next open the app and silently re-connects it for you, keeping all your settings. The behind-the-scenes notification handler was also hardened so every alert reliably shows.','📡 <b>RSS feed turned off for now</b> — the “Copy RSS link” option has been removed while we focus on making push notifications themselves dependable.'],},
  {ver:'v5.21',date:'2026-06-19',items:['🔒 <b>RSS feed hardening</b> — your private feed link no longer exposes your manage code (so a shared link still can\'t be used to turn your alerts off), and a temporary radar hiccup can no longer post a misleading "all clear" briefing to your feed. The copy button also refreshes your link automatically if your device code ever changes.'],},
  {ver:'v5.20',date:'2026-06-19',items:['📡 <b>New per-device RSS feed</b> — a reliable pull-based backup for when push notifications are unreliable (especially on iPhone). Open <b>Settings → Background alerts</b> and tap <b>📡 Copy RSS link</b>, then paste it into any RSS reader. It always shows your latest storm briefing, posts a fresh one at least every <b>30 minutes</b>, and adds a new entry right away when conditions change. How often your reader checks is up to that app.'],},
  {ver:'v5.19',date:'2026-06-19',items:['🔢 <b>Your manage code now stays the same</b> — turning background alerts off and back on used to give you a brand-new code every time. Now each phone keeps <b>one steady code</b> for as long as the app is installed, so re-enabling alerts reuses it instead of creating a new one.'],},
  {ver:'v5.18',date:'2026-06-19',items:['🔔 <b>Real storm alerts now actually reach your phone</b> — fixed a problem where the test notification worked but live rain, lightning and storm alerts never showed up. The app was sending too many separate notifications too quickly (and to leftover duplicate sign-ups from past setting changes), which phones quietly block. Now each place sends a <b>single combined alert</b> per check, repeat pings are spaced out a little, and changing your settings no longer leaves duplicate sign-ups behind. Serious weather (severe rain, lightning, warnings) still comes through fast.'],},
  {ver:'v5.17',date:'2026-06-19',items:['🔔 <b>“Send test notification” button</b> — under Settings → Background alerts (when alerts are ON), there’s now a button to send yourself a real test push. It travels the <b>exact same path as a genuine storm alert</b> — straight through the server — so it actually proves your phone will get notifications, not just a fake pop-up. It arrives within about a minute. If nothing shows up, it’s a sign notifications may be blocked in your device settings.'],},

Set it all under Settings → Background Alerts, or just leave the smart defaults.','🔔 <b>Each alert type is its own notification now</b> — instead of one big bundled alert, warnings, watches, advisories, storms and tropical each arrive as their own separate notification so they’re easier to read and stack neatly on your phone.'],},
  {ver:'v5.13',date:'2026-06-18',items:['🌧️ <b>“Rain right over you” has its own timer now</b> — the overhead-rain alert no longer borrows the timing from whichever band matched; it has its own re-notify dropdown right next to its on/off switch (above the four bands), with the same choices (every time / 5 / 10 / 15 / 30 / 45 / 60 min). The four bands still decide which rain intensities are worth alerting on — they just don’t control the overhead timing anymore.'],},
  {ver:'v5.12',date:'2026-06-18',items:['⏱️ <b>More re-alert timer choices</b> — each rain intensity band now offers <b>45 min</b> and <b>60 min</b> between repeat alerts, plus an <b>“every time”</b> option (no cooldown) if you want a notification on every check.

Toggle it on in Settings → Rain Intensity Bands.','🎚️ <b>Rain intensity bands</b> — four color-coded bands (Light 20–29, Moderate 30–44, Heavy 45–54, Severe 55+ dBZ), each with its own on/off switch and re-alert timer (every 5/10/15/30 min). These bands control which intensities trigger your inbound-storm alerts AND the new overhead-rain alerts, and how often each can re-notify, both in the app and in background push.'],},
  {ver:'v5.10',date:'2026-06-18',items:['🎯 <b>Clearer “in path” rain on storm cards</b> — the 💧 <i>In path</i> line on each Storms-tab card now shows the strongest rain (max dBZ) and number of returns along the storm’s path <b>toward you</b>, instead of scanning the entire 80-mile radius. Before, a strong cell far away in the same general direction could show up as a misleading “55 dBZ max” even when the storm itself was only 30 dBZ. Now the number matches what that storm is actually bringing your way.']},

Every watched location sends its own notification with the location’s name right in the header, so you always know which place an alert is about — all while StormTracker is closed.','🌬️ <b>More accurate background wind/gust alerts</b> — background notifications now use the same blended weather-station readings the app shows on screen (nearest official station + model), instead of model-only numbers. This fixes cases where the app showed gusts over your limit but no background alert arrived.']},
  {ver:'v5.08',date:'2026-06-18',items:['🎨 <b>Smoother radar colors</b> — refined the new palette so it reads as a clean gradient: each color fades from light to deep as rain gets stronger (deeper = more intense), and the color only changes at the next level up. Removed the very dark blues/greens/reds that turned muddy on the map, so everything stays bright and easy to read.','🖌️ <b>Customize radar colors</b> — new “Radar Colors” section in Settings lets you set your own color for every rain intensity (dBZ).

  {ver:'v5.04',date:'2026-06-18',items:['🔧 Fixed the <b>Background Storm Alerts</b> panel sometimes showing up blank — no on/off toggle, no manage code. The part of the app that draws that panel wasn\'t being saved for offline use, so on a weak signal it could fail to load and leave the section empty.

  {ver:'v5.03',date:'2026-06-18',items:['⏱️ Background scans now run on a steady, predictable schedule — every 5 minutes — instead of the random 5–60 minute spacing used before.

The clock now sweeps a cone reaching upwind from your location and catches every bit of rain (down to light/drizzle) that will pass over you, so the arc paints as one continuous stretch from now through when the back edge of the rain finally clears.
