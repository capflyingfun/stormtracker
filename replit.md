# StormTracker - Real-Time Storm Detection Application

## Overview

StormTracker is a real-time storm detection web application providing live weather radar maps, storm tracking, and weather alerts. It uses GPS or manual location input to monitor storm activity within a customizable radius. The application is enhanced with AI-powered weather analysis, integrating National Weather Service Area Forecast Discussions for comprehensive meteorological assessments. The project aims to deliver a professional, reliable, and user-friendly tool for anticipating and reacting to severe weather, with a vision to become a leading platform for public safety and meteorological insight. Current version: **v5.32** (cache bust ?v=631, SW cache stormtracker-v631).

For a full per-version changelog, see [`docs/CHANGELOG.md`](docs/CHANGELOG.md).

## Repository Structure

This repository contains the **live StormTracker app**: a static, vanilla-JavaScript Progressive Web App (PWA) in `docs/`, deployed via GitHub Pages, plus its supporting services:
- `docs/` — the live PWA (HTML/CSS/JS, no build step).
- `scanner/` — GitHub Actions storm scanner that powers background push alerts (own `package.json`).
- `worker/` — Cloudflare Worker for push notifications and the RSS backup feed (`wrangler.toml`, D1 schema).
- `windy-plugin-stormtracker/` — a separate, self-contained Windy.com plugin (own build).
- `scripts/`, `.github/workflows/` — asset generation and automation.

The older **React + Express + TypeScript** version (which rendered "v1.50") has been moved to its own private repository, `CAPFlyingFun/StormTracker-TS`, to keep the two projects from being confused. Nothing in this repo depends on it. The local Replit preview serves `docs/` directly (static file server on port 5000).

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language with customizable AI assistant tone options (Professional, Friendly, Humorous) similar to Carrot Weather app for personalized user experience.

## System Architecture

### Frontend (live app)
- **Framework**: Vanilla JavaScript — a static HTML/CSS/JS PWA in `docs/` with no build step. Scripts load in order via global-scope `<script>` tags (see "JavaScript Module Structure" below).
- **Styling**: Hand-written CSS (`docs/css/style.css`).
- **Mapping**: Leaflet for interactive maps.
- **UI/UX**: Mobile-first design featuring interactive Leaflet-based maps, real-time storm tracking panels, and an intuitive alert system. Includes sonar-style radar, 3D storm visualization, and professional meteorological color schemes.
- **Multilingual Support**: Supports 20 languages with auto-detection, persistence, RTL support, and a dynamic auto-translation system using OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini for UI strings.
- **Archived TypeScript/React version**: The earlier build used React 18 + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui and Radix UI, React Query, and Wouter. That version now lives in the separate `StormTracker-TS` repo.

### Backend / Services (live app)
- **Hosting**: Static site on GitHub Pages (there is no app server in this repo).
- **Push & sync**: Cloudflare Worker (`worker/`) backed by D1 (SQLite).
- **Background scanning**: GitHub Actions runs `scanner/` on a schedule to detect storms and trigger push alerts.
- **Data**: Most weather logic runs client-side in the browser, calling external APIs directly or via the Worker proxy.
- **Archived backend**: The earlier version's Express + Drizzle ORM + PostgreSQL (Neon) backend lives in the separate `StormTracker-TS` repo; the PostgreSQL/Neon entries under External Dependencies refer to that archived version.
- **Core Features**:
    - **Location Services**: GPS detection and OpenWeather geocoding.
    - **Weather Data Integration**: Multiple sources including OpenWeather, RainViewer, NEXRAD, and government weather services.
    - **Storm Detection & Tracking**: Multi-source data integration, sector-based analysis, pixel sampling, intelligent clustering, frame-by-frame radar comparison, and directional movement predictions.
    - **AI Weather Assistant**: OpenAI GPT-4o integration for risk assessment, comprehensive weather analysis, and chat functionality.
    - **Lightning Detection**: Radar-derived indicators with customizable display.
    - **Alert System**: Personalized, real-time risk alerts based on intensity and distance, integrated with NWS alerts, chronological sorting, and AI-powered translation. Features impact threshold filters, color-coded borders, and live countdown timers.
    - **Wind Speed Simulator**: Range-based model (Floor=WS−50%, Ceiling=WG+10%) with configurable sim interval target picking and smoothstep lerp. Configurable rolling gust/avg windows. AWC refresh syncs both speed and gust data. Wind trend arrows (↑↓→) on all gauge styles.
    - **Sonar Point Clustering**: Grid-based spatial hash (`_clusterSonarPoints()`) reduces 2K-5K raw scan points to ~300-800 clustered points for sonar rendering. Resolution adapts to zoom level. Preserves `_rawScanPts` for storm detection/zones. Cluster dot size scales with merged count.
    - **Storm Feedback System**: Collects user feedback on storm impact to refine prediction accuracy.
    - **Messaging System**: Database-driven inbox for alerts.
    - **Aviation Weather**: Multi-source METAR data and AI analysis.
    - **Weather Station (PWS Console)**: Dedicated interface for real-time METAR data from AWC, including wind compass, various gauges, barometric pressure trends, precipitation, cloud cover, moon phase, forecast icon strip, and a METAR decoder. Features 24-hour history with sparkline charts, pressure tendency charts, wind distribution charts, and a condition timeline. Supports multi-station TAFs and station favoriting.
    - **Global Timezone System**: Comprehensive timezone handling.
    - **Location Management System**: Three-tier system for managing and scanning locations (Home, Scan Here, HD Scan).
